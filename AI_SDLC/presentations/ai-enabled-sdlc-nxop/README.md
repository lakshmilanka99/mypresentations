# AI-Enabled SDLC for NXOP Presentation

## Overview
This presentation addresses the critical challenge of scaling mainframe modernization for the NXOP program at American Airlines.

## Key Message
The current development cycle time (18 days per feature) is not scalable for a multi-year program involving 200+ legacy applications. AI-enabled SDLC can reduce cycle time by 78% and make the program viable.

## Presentation Structure

1. **Title Slide** - AI-Enabled SDLC for NXOP
2. **Current State Metrics** - 18 days/feature, 35% manual testing, 4.2x rework
3. **Development Cycle Breakdown** - Visual chart showing time spent per activity
4. **The Challenge** - 200 apps × 18 days = 10 years (unsustainable)
5. **Scalability Gap** - Chart showing capacity vs. requirements over 5 years
6. **Bottleneck Analysis** - Code translation (40%), testing (30%), documentation (15%), knowledge silos (15%)
7. **Resource Impact** - Would need 150+ developers vs. 40 with AI
8. **Risk Assessment** - Without change: 8-10 years, 200-300% cost overrun
9. **The Solution** - AI-enabled SDLC: 3-4 days/feature, 78% reduction
10. **AI Capabilities** - Code translation, test generation, documentation, code review
11. **Implementation Roadmap** - 4-phase approach starting Q1 2026
12. **Expected Outcomes** - $45M savings, 8 years saved, 5x productivity
13. **Next Steps** - Pilot program approval and 90-day success criteria
14. **Thank You** - Q&A and contact information

## Data Points

### Current State
- Development cycle: 18 days per feature
- Manual testing: 35% of effort
- Rework cycles: 4.2x average
- Program scope: 200+ applications, 5M+ lines of COBOL

### With AI-Enabled SDLC
- Development cycle: 3-4 days (78% reduction)
- Manual testing: 5% (86% reduction)
- Rework cycles: 1.3x (69% improvement)
- Program timeline: 2 years vs. 10 years (80% faster)

### Business Impact
- Cost savings: $45M
- Time saved: 8 years
- Productivity gain: 5x
- Required team: 40 vs. 150 developers
